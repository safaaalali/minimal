# Safaa Al-Ali, Ph.D. 

 **About me**

_Hello!_ Since October 2022, I am post-doctoral researcher at Centre Inria d'Université Côte d'Azur, [Epione Team](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/). I am currently specializing in biomedical data analysis. My work focuses on conducting causal analysis for multimodal data, incorporating insights from bio-markers, signals, and images. My journey in academia led me to complete a Ph.D. in the intricate realm of mathematical modeling of biological conditions. Passionate about the intersection of mathematics and science, I proudly identify as a "mathematician" blending the precision of mathematics with the curiosity-driven exploration of biological systems. My professional endeavors aim to unravel the complexities within biomedical data, contributing to advancements in our understanding of health and disease. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of biomedical research. 

## Research projects:
